A Supplication to the Master Himself: The Essence of Mañjughoṣa To the sovereign lama, Khyentse Wangpo, The essence of the vajras of body, speech, and mind Of Mañjughoṣa and all the victorious ones in the ten directions, I supplicate from my heart-bless me! Prosper, O lord, for oceans of eons! Without interruption, take care of beings like me until the essence of enlightenment Pacifies the external and internal obstacles, And bless us to accomplish benefits for ourselves and others! This was composed by Khyentse Wangpo himself at the request of Deden Kunga and Jampa Puntsok. May it be virtuous!
